This is a free library I developed because of the need of some extra functionalities in my projects. These are some of the things you will find out:

 - Easy convert raw byte data into primitive types and viceversa
 - Manage streams in data structures.
 - Measure time
 - Some maths and statistics
 - Audio stuff and signal generators
    
Feel free to download it and use as a Java or an Android library through git submodule.

To use the AndroidStudio gradle module, switch to 'android' branch.

Lincesed under Apache 2.0.
